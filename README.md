# MadHasher

Create unlimited password hashes using the hashing algorithm of your choice through simple text input.

## Instructions

Using this script is as simple as running `HashMaker.sh` from command line, specifying which hashing algorithm you prefer, and subsequently inputting as many passwords as you would like hashed. By simply inputting plain text passwords in the script, the hashed password is then appended to `HashFile_[Hash Type].txt`. This allows for easily creating simple hash tables.
